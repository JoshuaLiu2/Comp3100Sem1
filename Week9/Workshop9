Task 1: Identify pros and cons of each of three baseline algorithms.
Task 2: Run simulations with each of them using ds-config01–wk9.xml
Task 2.1: Run them in the normal mode
Task 2.2: Run them in the interactive mode (using “-i” with ds-server)

First fit
-uses all 3 servers
-costs less
-faster turn around time
-does not check cores, allocates to first capable server available
-time efficient

Best fit
-uses all 3 servers
-costs less
-faster turn around time
-needs to check cores available/based of core count
-schedules jobs regardless of availability
-processing efficient

Worst fit
-uses less servers (2 servers used)
-costs more
-longer turn around time
-
